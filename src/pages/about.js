This taught me my strongest life lesson: you can do anything I set my mind to. It led me down the path of getting my BSc. in Exercise Physiology. While in university, I opened my own independent personal training business. I needed a website to advertise myself, so I decided to build my own.. and that was it, I was addicted.",

I finished with honors along with 6 weeks of TAing for the Computer Science curriculum (Data Structures & Algorithms, C lang, & OS/Processes).
