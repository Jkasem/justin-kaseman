    - paragraph: "Iâ€™m a San Fransisco Bay Area native born and raised. My background is in health and fitness which grew from my own body transformation in which I lost 100lbs. This taught me my strongest life lesson: you can do anything I set my mind to. It led me down the path of getting my BSc. in Exercise Physiology. While in university, I opened my own independent personal training business. I needed a website to advertise myself, so I decided to build my own.. and that was it, I was addicted."
    - paragraph: "After graduation, I spent the next 6 months engrossed self-studying. I enrolled in Lambda School, a full time intensive 7.5 month long Computer Science Academy. I finished with honors along with 6 weeks of TAing for the Computer Science curriculum (Data Structures & Algorithms, C lang, & OS/Processes). Software Engineering has given me an outlet to fulfill my greatest passions: creating stuff, solving problems, and lifelong learning."
