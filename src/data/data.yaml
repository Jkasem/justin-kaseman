    - "Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Justin Kaseman, a San Fransisco Bay Area native - born and raised. My original love for technology stems all way back to a childhood of staying up late playing video games and gorging on junk food. It was highly un-sustainable. One day a spark ignited my 4-month weight loss transformation of over 100lbs."
    - "Through this, my deep love of self-improvement formed and fostered one of my strongest beliefs: with enough motivation and daily consistency anyone can achieve their goals. This led me through a BSc. in Exercise Physiology to learn how I could best help other people achieve similar results. While attending university, I opened an independent personal training business. But to market a business without a storefront I needed a website...so why not build it myself? A new addiction was born."
    - "Suddenly my evenings and weekends were spent in furious self-study. I had finally found my passion. I enrolled in Lambda School, a full time intensive 7.5 month long Computer Science Academy, with a focus on Full-Stack Web Development. To continue helping other students I was a Teacher's Assistant for the Computer Science curriculum."
    - "I currently spend my days playing as a Software Engineer at MediaJel, learning and building solutions for emerging markets to best reach their consumers."
